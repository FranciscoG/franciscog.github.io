# Miscellany

I maintain a [Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3dBiKJSoAQ6msoYzl99wp2?si=9b28df94ffc440be) of downtempo chill electronic music that I like to listen to while working. I originally started this playlist as a collaborative one that I posted on some dev related subreddits, hence the name "Reddit Coders: Downtempo". It was going well for a while but then someone wiped out the whole playlist one day. Thankfully I kept a back-up but it's no longer collaborative because we can't have nice things.
